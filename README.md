# rProtocols

**rProtocols** is an open, decentralized framework for publishing, adopting, and evolving **protocols** — clear, reusable patterns for collaboration — without relying on hierarchy, force, or control.

These protocols describe **how to work together** in ways that are transparent, composable, and adaptable. They can be as simple as a single pattern of action or grouped into **protocol suites** for more complex collaborative needs.

---

## Why rProtocols?

Most collaboration today relies on rules, policies, or agreements that are static, centralized, and slow to change. rProtocols replaces these with **living protocols**: small, modular, and open for anyone to adapt.

This approach:
- Keeps collaboration **peer-to-peer** and **self-organizing**.
- Makes **patterns** explicit so they can be shared and improved.
- Encourages **adoption through use**, not enforcement.
- Creates a **public history of changes** for transparency.

## Core Concepts

### **Needs**
Every protocol begins with a *Need* — a clearly stated purpose for why the protocol exists.  
Participants can **follow** needs to stay informed as related protocols evolve.

### **Protocols**
A protocol is a documented pattern that addresses a specific need.  
It includes:
- **Need** it addresses  
- **Context** where it applies  
- **Purpose** it serves  
- **Pattern of interaction or process**  
- **Adoption & follow signals** to show community use

### **Protocol Suites**
A set of protocols that work together.  
When you follow or adopt a suite, you automatically follow/adopt all its protocols.

---

## Follow & Adopt

- **Follow**: Stay informed about changes, forks, and new versions. Available for *needs*, *protocols*, and *suites*.  
- **Adopt**: Publicly declare you are using a protocol or suite. (Not available for needs.)

---

## Versioning & Adaptation

- Every change creates a **new cryptographically linked version**.  
- Protocols can be **forked** to adapt them to new contexts.  
- Public adoption and following signals help track **which protocols are active** and relevant.

## rProtocols and AT Protocol

The next generation of rProtocols will be built as a **stand-alone AT Protocol web app**, using:
- **NSIDs** to define the rProtocols lexicon
- **Radical Life Functions ontology** to structure and relate protocols
- **Open, distributed data** so anyone can run or connect their own instance

---

## Who Can Use rProtocols?

- **Individuals** – Document ways of working you want to share or improve.  
- **Groups & Teams** – Replace static policies with adaptable patterns.  
- **Networks** – Create shared suites of patterns across organizations.
